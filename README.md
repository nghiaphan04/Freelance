# Freelancer Web3 Platform â€“ System Overview

This system is designed to build a **decentralized freelance marketplace (Web3)** on the Cardano blockchain.  
The main components include:

- **User**:  
  - **Client**: Posts projects, funds escrow, and can raise disputes.  
  - **Freelancer**: Registers, stakes a deposit, and can also raise disputes when necessary.

- **Platform (Web3 Freelance Platform)**:  
  Acts as the core layer that connects clients and freelancers, manages escrow contracts, and routes dispute processes.

- **AI Verification**:  
  Provides identity and reputation services through face/ID verification, reputation scoring, job recommendations, and vote suggestions.  
  Connected to the **DID Contract** for decentralized identity verification recorded on-chain.

- **Escrow Reward**:  
  Manages the **Escrow Contract** and the **Reward Pool Contract**, ensuring that project funds and staking rewards are securely handled.

- **Governance**:  
  A **DAO / Expert Arbitrators Contract** is responsible for dispute resolution and governance, ensuring fair and transparent decision-making.

- **Blockchain (Cardano)**:  
  All DID records, escrow deposits, rewards, and DAO governance are executed and verified on the Cardano blockchain for security, transparency, and decentralization.
